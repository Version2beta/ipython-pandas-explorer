# iPython and Pandas explorer

This repository holds some python resources used in my iPython and Pandas presentation for the SLC Python meetup.

## How to use this

0. If you're on ubuntu, ipython notebook is more easily installed via: `sudo apt-get install ipython-notebook`. Virtualenv / `pip` installs won't work because of some wonkiness with `pyzmq`
0. `pip install -r requirements.txt` - get the pip packages (might need `sudo`)
0. `ipython notebook` - launch iPython Notebook (will also launch your browser)
0. Explore and profit.
